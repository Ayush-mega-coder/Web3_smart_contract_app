## Building a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contract

building a website where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write from).

writing + deploying the smart contract and building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.
when someone waves at you there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from your site :).
